# MongoDB Vectors

This repository is a playground for experimenting with **MongoDB Atlas Vector Search** and its applications in AI.  
It contains multiple example projects that demonstrate how to store embeddings in MongoDB, perform vector search, and build real-world use cases around it.

## ðŸ“‚ Packages

### 1. [mongodb-book-vector](./mongodb-book-vector/README.md)
A project that demonstrates using MongoDB vector search for **semantic book search**.  
- Loads book embeddings into MongoDB.  
- Performs similarity queries to retrieve relevant books.  
- Useful as a reference for document-based semantic search.  

---

### 2. [mongodb-news-vector](./mongodb-news-vector/README.md)
A project that demonstrates **news article search** powered by MongoDB vectors.  
- Stores news article embeddings.  
- Enables fast similarity-based retrieval of articles.  
- Showcases practical usage of vector search for information retrieval.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ehbraheem/mongodb-vectors.git
cd mongodb-vectors
````

Each sub-package (`mongodb-book-vector` and `mongodb-news-vector`) has its own setup guide and dependencies.
Please follow their respective [READMEs](./mongodb-book-vector/README.md) and [READMEs](./mongodb-news-vector/README.md) for installation and usage instructions.
