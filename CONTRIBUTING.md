## üìù Code Style

* Follow **ES Modules** (`import`/`export`) syntax.
* Keep examples **minimal and focused**.
* Document your code where necessary.
* If adding a new example, include a short `README.md` inside the example folder explaining:

  * What the example demonstrates
  * How to run it
  * Expected output

---

## ‚úÖ Pull Request Guidelines

* Make sure your branch is up to date with `main`.
* Test your code before submitting.
* PR titles should be clear, e.g.,

  * `feat: add hybrid search example`
  * `fix: update env config loader`
  * `docs: improve setup instructions`
